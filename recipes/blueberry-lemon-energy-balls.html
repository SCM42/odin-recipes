        Add walnuts, dates and blueberries to a food processor; process until
        chopped and combined, 7 to 10 seconds. Add oats, maple syrup and lemon
        juice. Continue processing until a smooth, thick paste forms, 20 to 30
        seconds. Transfer the paste to a small bowl; add lemon zest and mix to
