        <!-- Description -->
        <h2>A creamy (yet, healthy!) bowl of seafood potato soup.</h2>

        <p>This delicious soup uses leftover shrimp tails to make a beautiful and savory seafood stock. You can use the tails to make the stock separately or (if you're feeling lazy) wrap them in a cheesecloth and simmer them in the soup as it cooks.</p>
        
        <p>It only takes about 15 minutes to extract the flavor and once done, all you have to do is stir in some low-fat greek yogurt and shredded monterey jack cheese for a healthier bowl of potato soup that's perfect for the winter season!</p>

        <!-- Recipe Steps -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Remove tails and shells from shrimp and tie off in cheesecloth. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In dutch oven, heat olive oil/butter and sauté bay leaf by itself to release flavor.</li>
            <li>Add carrots, celery and onion to pot. Season with salt and pepper and sauté on medium low heat for around 10 minutes or until vegetables look browned.</li>
            <li>Add in garlic and stir. Once aromatic, deglaze pot with chicken stock.</li>
            <li>Turn up heat to high and bring to a boil. Add in potatoes, shells, thyme, dill, cayenne, salt and pepper. Reduce heat back to medium and simmer uncovered for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove shells from pot. In a small cup or bowl, take a little of the hot soup broth and whisk it into the greek yogurt. This tempers the yogurt and is a crucial step to keep it from curdling. Once adequately combined, stir the yogurt into the soup.</li>
            <li>Taste and season as desired then turn to heat low and cover. Simmer for another 15-20 minutes or until potatoes are fully cooked.
            </li>
            <li>Remove bay leaf and turn off heat. Add shrimp to pot (it will cook within 2 to 3 minutes). Stir in shredded cheese and worcestershire sauce. Season to taste and garnish with green onions and parsley. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
