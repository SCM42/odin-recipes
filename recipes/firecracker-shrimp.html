    <!-- Description -->
    <h2>
      Spicy, stir-fried shrimp with peppers and onions all coated in a savory
      black bean sauce.
    </h2>

    <p>
      A favorite limited menu item of many at Panda Express, myself included. I
      had the pleasure of trying this out over the summer last year and was
      disappointed to know that it would not be staying. So naturally, I had to
      try and make it myself.

    <!-- Steps List -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place shrimp in a re-sealable plastic bag. Stir together other
        ingredients in a small bowl. Pour mixture over shrimp and seal bag.
        Refrigerate up to 4 hours or until cooking time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat vegetable oil in a large wok (or nonstick skillet) until very hot.
        Add marinated shrimp and quickly cook over high heat, stirring
        constantly, until shrimp is just cooked through and turns opaque in
        color, about 1 to 2 minutes. Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon to
        serving dish and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add bell peppers, onion, green beans, dried chile peppers, garlic and
        ginger, red pepper flakes, black bean garlic sauce and 1 Tbsp. water to
        wok. Cook over high heat, stirring frequently, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add shrimp back to wok and cook, stirring constantly, 2 minutes longer
        or until sauce has thickened and is bubbling. Stir in sesame oil just
        before serving. Serve hot with rice or noodles.
