This is the first project you do under The Odin Project curriculum. The goal is to just practice creating a barebones website for recipes using html.

Pages in project: One homepage (index.html) and three recipes.

Homepage contains an unordered list linking to each recipe.

Each recipe page features:
- An anchor element linking to index.html (home)
- Headers for recipe title, ingredients and directions.
- An img element linking to recipe image as well as an alt attribute describing image. There was also some sizing done with width and height attributes, although I don't have a very good gauge on properly sizing images this way.
- Paragraph elements describing the recipe.
- An unordered list for ingredients
- An ordered list for recipe directions

Project also had us practicing writing HTML boilerplate which at this point in the curriculm is just writing the DOCTYPE declaration, setting the lang attribute to "en", meta charset to "UTF-8" and including a title.
